# password_manager_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started


This is a password generating/managing app. The app has a simple yet sleek interface.
This is a multi-user app where users can login through their email or with their already existing google account.

On Startup, user is greeted with login screen and upon logging in, user is welcomed to dashboard where all of his saved passwords are stored and displayed.
Everything is stored on cloud firestore and loaded when user is logged in. User can also generate random passwords of length ranging 8-50 which can include lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters upon checkbox selection.

The user can copy password and user anywhere he wants. 
User can also save passwords, app name and email within the app and keep record of it.
